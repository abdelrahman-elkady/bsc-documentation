\chapter{Architecture and Implementation}
\label{chap:architecture_and_implementation}

In this chapter we have the implementation and the architecture of \ac{sems}, showing the main system modules, design decisions,
problems and impediments and their solutions and the design approaches taken during the implementation of \ac{sems}.

\section{Framework Selection}
\label{sec:framework_selection}
Before starting the implementation of the project, we examined some frameworks, most of them are \ac{js} ( NodeJS ) based;
this is due to the current state of \ac{js} community where one can find a well structured and maintained projects and modules.

\newParagraph
We started to do a quick tests and comparisons between Express.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js and meteor.js; the main goal was to have a stable
and functional system in the shortest period possible, that was required because \ac{sems} was planned to be used in the same year, forcing
us to have a production-ready application within 2 weeks of the project start.

\newParagraph
With that in mind, we chose meteor.js as our main framework, supported with blaze templating engine for the views, and mongoDB as the
database system, allowing us to push forward and focus on system design quickly while maintaining a stable application and framework
to be ready for production releases.
