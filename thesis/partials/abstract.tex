\noindent
Because of the huge number of students attending this course, and the different tools used to manage the course process, this course requires a lot of manual
handling using different tools, this lead to some complications and problems to reach and handle the data of the students, in this project, we are trying to construct a system that handles the management of the course in an easy and effective
way for both students and instructors .
