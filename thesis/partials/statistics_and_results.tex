\chapter{Statistics and Results}
\label{chap:statistics}

In this chapter, we show information and data collected from MixPanel\texttrademark{} analytics and from system users feedback, this data shows
overall system satisfaction, user retention, different service rating, effect of updating some services and/or introducing new services on the system.

\subsection{User Retention}
\label{sub:user-retention}

MixPanel\texttrademark{} shows the retention data, the columns shows the returned users in n weeks, it shows that after having a fair stable version
the user retention is increased, it kept stable though with a small difference starting from Mar 28\textsuperscript{th}, this is a bit applicable, given
that users usually comeback when the system have new updates, or when a new announcement or milestone is published, as will be shown in next sections.

\subsection{Page Visits}
\label{sub:page-visits}

Generic page visits graphs can show the interest and the traffic spikes throughout the duration of the course, figure \ref{fig:sems-general-graphs}
shows a sample of 3 frequently visited pages on the system and their visit rate throughout the course, in blue is the home page,
cyan is the team view for members and in purple the team browser, this graphs shows that users are normally having a stable rate of visit, with some
spikes on new feature releases, or when a new announcement is published, in \ref{fig:sems-general-graphs}, the spikes on 29\textsuperscript{th} of March and
12\textsuperscript{th} of April were a new milestone announcement for example, while the spike on the 29\textsuperscript{th} of February was the first
introduction of user registration after a static website stage.

\subsection{Viewing Deployments}
\label{sub:deployments-views}
To measure if allowing teams to share their deployed application with other teams attracted students to see others work or not, we created
a funnel on MixPanel\texttrademark{} that measures the number of students that browses the teams and launches the deployments of other teams during
one month, the results showed that about 60\% of users visiting team browser launches at least one deployment as the first action after visiting the
page as shown in \ref{fig:sems-deployments}. Also we provided a feedback form, where 168 student sent their feedback about the system, we
asked them if it was motivating or demotivating to see other teams deployments, the graph in \ref{fig:sems-deployments-survey} shows that around 70\%
of students found it incentive to see other teams deployments.
