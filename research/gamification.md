## What is gamification ?
The use of **game elements** and **game design techniques** into non-game contexts

- Learning from games ( what games can teach us ? )
- Learning from game design
- Appreciating fun !

#### Some Game Elements examples :
- Progress
- points
- Resources/Cash
- Levels
- Rewards
- Badges
- Quests/Challenges


## What is a game ?

There is one definition for some elements that describes a game
- Having a goal
- Having a set of rules
- Having a game attitude, which means that the player will **voluntarily** accept those rules in order to find that "game flavor", even if those rules are limiting his freedom

#### Games vs Play





People loves **gaining** than losing, make the grading feels like they are gaining points
not losing ones, Count up for the grades, like [Lee sheldon's approach](https://gamingtheclassroom.wordpress.com/syllabus/)
