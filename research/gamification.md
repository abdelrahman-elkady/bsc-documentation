## What is gamification ?
The use of **game elements** and **game design techniques** into non-game contexts

#### Some Game Elements examples :
- Progress
- points
- Resources/Cash
- Levels
- Rewards
- Badges
- Quests/Challenges








People loves **gaining** than losing, make the grading feels like they are gaining points
not losing ones, Count up for the grades, like [Lee sheldon's approach](https://gamingtheclassroom.wordpress.com/syllabus/)
