### [Analyzing StackOverflow point system](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ymovshov/Papers/asonam_2013.pdf) :
- Compared to Yahoo! Answers and other QA communities, it's shown that reputation system of SO is one of the factors that made it one of the most powerful  QA communities .
 > Tausczik and Pennebaker [11] showed that user reputation is consistently related to the perceived quality of their answer

- Users are rewarded more reputation for giving good answers than for asking good questions. (see table 1)

- 62% of the dataset have answers marked as accepted answers

- SO Schema encourages users to make better answers than better questions
  *This could be a nice approach to encourage the students more to help each other instead of trying to get help and leave*

- Still some users gains points by asking many questions, but the low points gained by upvoting the questions will make the user who make this approach easily detected by having a lot of **low quality questions** which can be handled by administrators .
